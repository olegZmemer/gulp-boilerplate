## How to work with that
* Put your HTML files into src folder
* Put your SASS into src/sass. Name it main.sass. It will compile to styles.min.css . 
* Put all your scripts into src/js . It will minify and transpile all JS files to (name).min.js
* Put all your images into src/img
* Put your fonts into src/fonts
